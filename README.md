# GitHub Practice

## Hello, My name is Jeff and I am a software developer at Ivey FinTech.

Your goal is to get a sentence like this about yourself into this README.

To accomplish this, try the following steps:

0. If you don't have Git installed, check out this [link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
1. Clone this repo. Open up your terminal (or Powershell for Windows users) and paste the following command: `git clone git@github.com:JefffffC/Github-Practice.git`. If that doesn't work, you don't have SSH enabled on your machine. You can try following [these steps](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh), or for now you can just `git clone https://github.com/JefffffC/Github-Practice.git`.
2. `cd Github-Practice`.
3. Open the project in your text editor of choice. I strongly recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
4. Check out a branch to do your work on. Give your branch a unique name. Something like `git checkout -b a_place_for_me_to_do_my_work_my_name_is_jeff`. Every time we start working on a new story or feature, we usually create a new branch. We call this a **feature** **branch**.
5. Edit this file to add your sentence and save the file.
6. Commit your work with a message that describes what you did: `git commit README.md -m "I added my sentence"`
7. Push your branch up back up to GitHub: `git push -u origin a_place_for_me_to_do_my_work_my_name_is_jeff` (Use the name of your branch, not mine!)
8. Go to GitHub and use the GUI to open a pull request. Request my review.
9. Once I have merged the pull request, you still want to get the latest code onto your `master` branch. To do this, `git checkout master` and then `git pull`.

## Now, try to add a sentence about yourself below this line.

## Hi, I'm Jeff and I like all-you-can-eat buffets. üç£

## Hi, I'm Carter and I'm really in need of some mechanical keyboard suggestions
