# GitHub Practice

## Hello, My name is Andy and I am a Software Enginer at RBI.

Your goal is to get a sentence like this about yourself into this README.

To accomplish this, try the following steps:

1. Clone this repo. Navigate to your Desktop on your Terminal and paste the following command: `git clone git@github.com:andyweiss1982/github_practice.git`. If that doesn't work, you don't have SSH enabled on your machine. You can try following [these steps](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh), or for now you can just `git clone https://github.com/andyweiss1982/github_practice.git`.
2. `cd github_practice`.
3. Open the project in your text editor: `code .`. If that command doesn't work for you, make sure you have VSCode installed and configured correctly: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line.
4. Check out a branch to do your work on. Give your branch a unique name. Something like `git checkout -b a_place_for_me_to_do_my_work_my_name_is_andy`.
5. Edit this file to add your sentence and save the file.
6. Commit your work with a message that describes what you did: `git commit README.md -m "I added my sentence"`
7. Push your branch up back up to GitHub: `git push -u origin a_place_for_me_to_do_my_work_my_name_is_andy` (Use the name of your branch, not mine!)
8. Go to GitHub and use the GUI to open a pull request. Request my review.
9. Once I have merged the pull request, you still want to get the latest code onto your `master` branch. To do this, `git checkout master` and then `git pull`.

## Now, try to add a sentence about yourself below this line.
